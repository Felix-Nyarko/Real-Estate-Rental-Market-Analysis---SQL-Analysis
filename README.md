A data analytics project using SQL to explore and analyze a house rentals dataset. The project focuses on querying property data to uncover insights such as rental price trends, regional comparisons, property conditions, and amenities distribution
# Introduction
# Background
## The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were;
Property Level Analysis
1. List the Top 10 most expensive properties with their name,price, bedrooms and location
2. Find the average rental price per bedroom count
3. Retrieve the properties with more than 3 bathrooms and sort them by price (descending)
4. Which category (flats, detached, etc) has the highest average floor area?
5. Show the average rental price per furnishing type (is furnished)

Location and Region Insights

6. Find te average rent by region
7. Get the top 5 localities with the highest average rental prices

Trends and Conditions

11. Count how many New Vrs Used properties are in the dataset
12. Find the average price per square meter (price/floor_area) for each region
13. How many properties have parking space compared to those without?
14. Which amenities appear most frequently across listings? (requires string search/processing)
